## Description

This is a README.md Generator that was developed as classwork for the University Of Utah Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp.

Here is a link to a video showing the functionality of the program. 

[video](/video.mp4)

Please note, when I recorded the video, it did not have a header for the Description section, however that has been added and will generate similarly to the other headers present in the README.md file.

Here is a photo showing where the change had been made post video creation.

Please note there are two README.md files. This file is the actual project README.md file, while the generated-README.md file is the one I made as an example of the raw functionality.
